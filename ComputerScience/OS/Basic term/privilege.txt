In this article, I will discuss the word "privilege".

------------------------------------------
Introduction to privilege:
Privilege determines which type of people have the ability to access.

------------------------------------------
Types:
In OS, there are 2 major modes.
(2.1)User mode:
It is the lowest privilege.
The system call can NOT be performed in this mode.
Users are always in users mode.

(2.2)Kernel mode:
It is the highest privilege.
Only the OS can switch it to kernel mode.
The system call can be performed in this mode.
Thus, the deletion and creation and modified files can be done in this mode.

------------------------------------------
Extra information:
Some People may stuck these issues.
Why can I delete my files using del on my keyboard in Windows 10?
In fact, when one tries to delete files using del on one's keyboard in Windows 10.
The OS automatically performs lots of things.
First, the deletion callback was invoked.
Then, the OS try to switch it to kernel mode.
After that, the OS invoke the system call to try to delete files.
If succeed, the files will be deleted. Otherwise, the error occurs.
